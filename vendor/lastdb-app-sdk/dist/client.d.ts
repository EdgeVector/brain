 * Surface verified against `origin/main`:
 * - consent flow handlers: `fold_db_node/src/server/routes/apps.rs`
 * - data path handlers: `fold_db_node::dev_mode` `app_endpoints.rs` (the dev mirror of
 *   production `fold_db_node`'s control-socket route table)
 * - capability header: `fold_db_node/src/handlers/caller.rs`
 *   (`X-App-Capability` = base64 JSON CapabilityToken, `X-Capability-Ts` =
